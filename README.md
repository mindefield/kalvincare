## Algorithms & AI Models

### Breed Detection
- Utilizes TensorFlow.js with a pre-trained model for dog breed classification
- Supports 120+ dog breeds with confidence scoring
- Image preprocessing pipeline for optimal detection accuracy
- Multi-breed detection for mixed breeds

### Health Analysis
- Weight status calculation using breed-specific standards
- Activity level recommendations based on:
  - Breed characteristics
  - Age and weight
  - Current activity level
- Health score computation considering:
  - Weight status
  - Activity level
  - Age appropriateness
  - Breed-specific health concerns

### Recommendation Engine
- Personalized activity recommendations
- Diet suggestions based on:
  - Breed requirements
  - Age and weight
  - Activity level
- Health alerts for potential concerns

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm (v9 or higher)
- MongoDB (optional, for production)
- Git

## Installation Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd kalvincare
```

### 2. Install Node.js and npm

If you don't have Node.js installed, install it using nvm (Node Version Manager):

```bash
# Install nvm
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash

# Reload shell configuration
source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc for Zsh

# Install Node.js
nvm install 18
nvm use 18

# Verify installation
node --version
npm --version
```

### 3. Backend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create uploads directory
mkdir uploads

# Create .env file
cp .env.example .env

# Start the backend server
npm run dev
```

The backend will run on http://localhost:9000

### 4. Frontend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd ../dog-health-app

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the frontend development server
npm run dev
```

The frontend will run on http://localhost:3000 (or the next available port if 3000 is in use)

## API Documentation

Once the backend is running, you can access the API documentation at:
http://localhost:9000/api-docs

### Available Endpoints

1. Breed Detection
   - POST /api/breed/detect
   - Accepts image file upload
   - Returns detected breeds with confidence scores

2. Health Analysis
   - POST /api/health/analyze
   - Accepts breed and health data
   - Returns health report and recommendations

3. Lead Capture
   - POST /api/lead/capture
   - Accepts user contact information
   - Stores lead data for follow-up

## Development

### Backend Development

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

The backend uses:
- Express.js
- TypeScript
- Swagger for API documentation
- Multer for file uploads

### Frontend Development

```bash
cd dog-health-app
npm run dev
```

The frontend uses:
- Next.js 15
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Headless UI
- React Hook Form

## Production Deployment

### Backend Deployment

1. Build the TypeScript code:
```bash
cd backend
npm run build
```

2. Start the production server:
```bash
npm start
```

### Frontend Deployment

1. Build the Next.js application:
```bash
cd dog-health-app
npm run build
```

2. Start the production server:
```bash
npm start
```

## Environment Variables

### Backend (.env)

```env
PORT=9000
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri  # Optional
NODE_ENV=development
```

### Frontend (.env.local)

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:9000
```

## Troubleshooting

1. Port Conflicts
   - If port 3000 is in use, Next.js will automatically try the next available port
   - Check the console output for the correct port number

2. MongoDB Connection
   - MongoDB is optional for development
   - The app will work without MongoDB in development mode
   - For production, set up MongoDB and provide the connection URI

3. Image Upload Issues
   - Ensure the uploads directory exists in the backend
   - Check file size limits (max 5MB)
   - Verify file types (JPG, JPEG, PNG)
